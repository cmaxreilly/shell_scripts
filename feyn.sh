#OBJECTIVE:
# Create a script that takes a command line input, converts that command line inpute to snake case, then makes that
# command line input the filename and title of a new file in my feynman_technique folder in my vault. The script will
# then append 3 lines of space, followed by the text "press R to insert explanation here," followed by 3 more lines of
# space. This will then do the same thing with a simplified explanation.



# Take command line input of concept to be learned

echo "What concept would you like to learn? Please use 12 characters or less."

read -r name




# Convert to snake case


# Make snake case phrase into file name, as well as append date


# Append original name, date in Month/dd/yyyy format, 3 blank lines, "Complex Description", <Insert Text here with 'R'>, 3 blank lines, "Simplified Description", <Insert Text here with 'R'>



# Vim filename starting at appropriate line, most likely <Insert> under Complex Description.
